    <br>
    <div id='a2'>At Callahan Dog Run we believe in the benefits of exercise for ourselves.</div>
    <br>
    <div id='a3'>However, we also look to the experts for advice. Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Robin Downing (DVM, CVPP, CCRP, DAAPM) wrote <a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/healthy-exercise-for-dogs" target="_blank">a fantastic article</a> with thoughts about dog activity. Below are some excerpts. </div>
    <br>
    <div id='a4'>"Just like humans, dogs derive health benefits from regular exercise. An important aspect of facilitating, enhancing, lengthening, and strengthening our relationships with our canine companions is to keep them strong and fit through physical activity."</div>
    <br>
    <div id='a5'>"Just like physical fitness programs for humans, steady, progressive conditioning is the best approach for dogs. Your veterinarian can play an important role in helping you choose appropriate targets for your canine fitness plan, including how long to exercise at one time and how to adapt specific activities to best fit your dogâ€™s individual needs."</div>
    <br>
    <div id='a6'>We will work with you to create the best experience for your dog. We are up for whatever amount of exercise is appropriate.</div>
